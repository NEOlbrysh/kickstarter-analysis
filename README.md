As we can see in the above graph food, games, music, and publishing all have high failure rates with litte success, journalism being the only one that is canceled entirely, with technology coming in second. Film & video, theater, and music being the most successful of the category.

Looking at the above graph it is more than evident that the most sucessful month is May, this could be due to weather as it is warming up and people are wanting to venture outside of their home. Holidays play a large role in the decline 
of months October through December due to the fact that disposable income is tied up in traveling, giftgiving, and parties.

It is evident that the more backers a campaign has directly correlates to the amount of donations recieved. Also the more backers there are the less donation a single person needs to give while still raising an appropriate amount of funds. 

# Conclusion and analysis
As we can see in the above graphs, theater has the highest success and fail rate amoungst the other categories. This is partly due to the time of year that production starts, we can see that spring time, particularly May is significantly more successful than any of the other months. The second reason campaigns are successful are due to backers and more importantly donations, the more backers a production has the more doantions are to be expected.
